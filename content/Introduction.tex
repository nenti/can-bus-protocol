\section{Introduction}
Modern automotive systems include many different hardware elements that interact
with other parts of the car. The Controller Area Network (CAN) is a bus system
developed by Bosch which meets the requirements of most parts used in a modern
car. The racing team of the university Paderborn uses the CAN bus system to
control the hardware elements of their racecar. To optmize the car's performance
on the track we are implementing a monitoring system which is able to monitor
and manipulate the CAN data from the bus. To understand the stream of data
transfered over the bus this paper will look into details of the CAN protocol.
The goal for the readers of this paper is to gain general knowledge about the
protocol so that they are able to program the interface between the CAN bus and
the monitoring GUI.

\section{Fieldbus for automotive systems}
Automotive systems include an increasing number of embedded electronic devices
to meet consumers requirements like entertainment, safety or drive assistance.
Powerfull IT innovations for vehicles are possible by interconnection and
communication between various electronic components. To efficiently implement
this interconnection, fieldbus systems were invented. 
	
	\cite{can-florian-rathgeber} 
	\subsection{Historical Placement of CAN} 
	Increasing cabeling costs and weight for the peer-to-peer
	connections between various controllers in cars introduced the demand for the
	fieldbus technology. In 1983 the Rober Bosch GmbH started the development of an
	in-vehicle network. The result of this research was officially introduced 1986
	as the CAN protocol. Only one year later the first hardware controllers were
	released by Intel and Philips Semiconductors. Even though CAN was developed for
	cars early applications were in the machine manufactoring. After Bosch released
	the CAN specification v2.0 1990 the ISO standard 11898 for CAN was published.
	Around the same time Mercedes Benz started using CAN in some of their
	series-production vehicles. Many other car manufacturors today use CAN or its
	later ancestors for their vehicle controller communication.
	
	\subsection{Requirements for automotive bus systems}
	Besides the reduced cable cost bus protocols solve more communication related
	problems. Error correction is one of the feature added to the CAN protocol by
	detecting transfer errors and propagating the missmatch to all connected CAN
	nodes. Often various different subsystems use similar sensors and therefor a
	bussystem enables the reuse of sensor data to save costs. In vehicles there are
	different systems with changing requirements on the bussystems. For example an
	airbag has hard real time requirements to ensure that the bag is filled before
	the head hits the dashboard. Whereas the entertainment system of a car needs a
	high throughput but is not required to have error correction in the bus. To address
	those requirements SAE described four classes of automotive requirements on
	bussystems.\cite{sae-classes} 
	
	\paragraph{CLASS A}
	This class describes low-end communication without many requirements on the
	bus. The goal for a bus that serves this class is to be cheap, provide a low
	bandwidth and no extra features like error correction. Mostly this kind of
	bus system is used for direct communication between sensors and actuators. The
	market leading bussystem used for this type of communication is called LIN
	(local interconnect networks)
	\paragraph{CLASS B}
	Systems that fit this class are using non-critical communication with a fairly
	low speed requirement of approximately 125Kb/sec. A good example for a system
	like that is the car body comfort system. Whereas it is not important that the
	windscreen whiper starts within a few milliseconds after you hit the button,
	error detection and correction is fairly important in those kind of systems to
	ensure a comfortable, deterministic user environment. The lowspeed CAN bus
	would be a typical bus system for this class because it provides excelent error
	correction and enough speed to meet the requirements.
	\paragraph{CLASS C}
	Class C covers expensive systems with high bandwidth, fault-tolerance and
	real-time requirements. Typical transmission speed is around 500 Kb/sec but
	modern systems like FlexRay or the upcoming CAN-FD (flexible
	datarate)\cite{canfd-conference} provide higher speed while maintaining or even
	extending the maximum buslength over the typical 40 meter. An example for a
	Class C system would be the engine control system.
	
	For our racing car, whose IT-infrastructure is not as cost-sensitive and
	complex as the one used in modern personal vehicles we only use one bus system.
	There are various different CAN nodes in place that meet all different classes. Using the CAN
	bus, following protocol ISO 11898-2, as our bussystem was a logical choice
	since it is fairly fault-tolerant and provides enough bandwidth for all
	connected devices. 
	
	After a short introduction into fieldbus systems and the CAN system the next
	chapter gives insight into how the CAN nodes communicate with each other
	following the CAN protocol. And how the CAN protocol provides the discussed
	feature of fault tolerance.
	

\section{CAN Busprotocol}
This section will include an introduction to the CAN Bus in general by
describing how it works. I will show the reader the differen layers of the CAN
bus on a layer diagram like the
	\autoref{fig:can_layers}

		\label{fig:can_layers}
	\end{figure}
\subsection{Message Framing}
Message framing is one of the main aspects of reading and understanding the
bitstream coming from the CAN bus. This section will outline the different
Message formats and go through their frame data structure in detail.
	\paragraph{Data Frame}
Sending 8 bytes of data.
	\paragraph{Remote Frame}
Requesting data from another node.
	\paragraph{Error Frame}
Propagation of an error occured in a transmission.
\subsection{Bus Arbitration}
Arbitration is an important part of a bus system which has several nodes
connected that want to communicate over the shared bus. The CAN bus uses
priority based arbitration which will be described in this section. I will also
include a discussion about real time requirements and the problem of suppressed
low priority nodes.
\subsection{Message Filtering}
In a bus system which uses broadcast and not packet-switching based data
transmission, filtering messages and identifying the correct receiver is a key
feature which will be described in this section.
\subsection{Error Management and Synchronisation}
CAN is a very reliable bus system because it runs synchronous and uses various
error detection and management procedures which will be described in this
section
	\paragraph{CRC Check}
In this subsection I will outline the CRC check.
	\paragraph{Bit Stuffing}
Bit Stuffing is used to prevent synchronisation errors.

\section{Bus Security Concerns}
Our project goal to connect a CAN bus with a wireless monitoring system
introduces a new threat to our car. Whereas the CAN bus used to be a closed
system which therefor was very hard to attack, we open up our bus
system to an uncontrollable audience by sending and receiving data via wireless
technology. Even though available countermeasures for the wireless
transmission is used, undesired wireless interaction with our CAN bus can not be
ruled out. This chapter will therefor outline upcoming threats for embedded CAN
communication and present proposals for countermeasures.

\section{Conclusion}
The CAN bus is a very reliable bus system because of its long historic
background and the sophisticated devices available on the market. Furthermore it
is still under development to keep up with the latest technologies while
maintaining its high standards of reliability.
